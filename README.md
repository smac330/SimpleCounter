# SimpleCounter App

A basic Android app made with Kotlin that lets you count up by tapping a button. Once you hit 100, you can upgrade the button to add 2 each time.

## Features

- Tap to increase a counter
- Upgrade unlocks at 100 to add +2
- Toast message on each click
- Simple UI using ConstraintLayout

## How It Works

- Start at 0 and press the "Add 1" button
- When the counter reaches 100, an upgrade button appears
- Pressing the upgrade changes the button to "Add 2"

## Files

- `MainActivity.kt`: Handles the button logic and counter
- `activity_main.xml`: Sets up the layout with a counter display and buttons
